Recreational Malloc System created as per the CS1_CS module

This project serves to provide a base of which Memory Management Systems work inside of an Operating System

This was a little something I wanted to make as per the CS1_CS module to be able to engage with the content a lot more.

# Usage:

``run the makefile using make (run as sudo if necessary)``
